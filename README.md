## 🐳 Dockerfile Details

The `Dockerfile` used for this application includes:
- **Base Image**: [e.g., Python:3.8-slim, Node:14-alpine]
- **Dependencies Installation**: Installs all required libraries and dependencies.
- **Port Exposure**: Exposes the application port (e.g., `EXPOSE 8080`).
- **Application Start**: Specifies the command to start the game application.

### Sample Dockerfile
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.8-slim

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy application code and install dependencies
COPY . /app
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# Expose the application port
EXPOSE 8080

# Start the application
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```
